%% Overview
% These codes are used for analyzing the data and reproducing the figures in Yiu et al.(2025)

%% Systems Requirements

%Hardware requirements:
%These codes requires only a standard computer.

%Software requirements:
%These codes are supported for MATLAB in both windows and macOS. 
%These codes has been tested on the following systems:

%% Demo 

%To run the analysis and plot the data, just simply click "Run Section" button in
%the MATLAB EDITOR. The code will automatically load the source data "Demo.mat" and the 
%results (a line plot with a black thick line representing mean + sem and 
%gray thin lines representing individual data points) will show up in a
%seprate window. The expected run time is just a few seconds:

%% Instruction of use
% To run the analysis and reproduce the plot of each panels, go to the
% respective folder for each figure and select the master file (e.g.,
% Figure1_master.m). Then, click "Run Section" button in
% the MATLAB EDITOR for the figure panels that you would like to reproduce. 
% The code will automatically load the source data and plot the 
% results.
